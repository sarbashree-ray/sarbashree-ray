🎯 Automation | Data Engineer | Generative AI Engineer | MLOps Engineer | Quantitative Analyst | 

🔧 Solving real-world problems with data, automation, and AI at scale
📍 Based in India

💼 Summary
With 9+ years of experience at the intersection of data engineering, cloud computing, and applied AI, I architect and implement production-grade systems across diverse domains including finance, telecom, and AI-driven automation. My work spans everything from building streaming data pipelines and trading algorithms to fine-tuning large language models and designing Agentic AI systems. I combine hands-on engineering with domain understanding to deliver scalable, secure, and insight-driven solutions.

🧪 Projects

•  Data Observability & Actionability Platform
Built a unified data health platform with end-to-end pipeline instrumentation, real-time anomaly detection (batch + streaming), automated remediation playbooks, and SLA-based alerting to ensure trusted data delivery at scale.

• Financial Data Quality & Alerting System
Developed PySpark–AWS streaming pipelines with Great Expectations to validate financial KPIs in real time, detect distribution shifts or schema drifts, and trigger Slack/SNS alerts for immediate remediation.

• Quantitative Trading Signal Engine
Engineered a high-throughput backtesting framework using historical tick data and machine learning models, integrating live simulations to generate and evaluate alpha signals before execution.

• Telecom Network Analytics Platform
Implemented large-scale Kafka-Spark ingest and AWS Lakehouse analytics to monitor network QoS, optimize capacity utilization, and surface fraud anomalies with custom alert workflows.

• Agentic AI Framework for Enterprise Automation
Created a multi-agent orchestration system using LangGraph and LangChain to autonomously triage IT tickets, perform diagnostics, and resolve incidents across telecom and finance domains.
